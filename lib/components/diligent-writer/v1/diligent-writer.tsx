        <ul>
            <li>
                (i) Never use a metaphor, simile, or other figure of speech which you are used to seeing in print.
                </li>
            <li>
                (ii) Never use a long word where a short one will do.
                </li>
            <li>
                (iii) If it is possible to cut a word out, always cut it out.
                </li>
            <li>
                (iv) Never use the passive where you can use the active.
                </li>
            <li>
                (v) Never use a foreign phrase, a scientific word, or a jargon word if you can think of an everyday English equivalent.
                </li>
            <li>
                (vi) Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.
